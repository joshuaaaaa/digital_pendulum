## 📌 Description

Digital Pendulum is a custom integration for Home Assistant that announces the time vocally, just like a digital pendulum 🕰️.


Using an Alexa device as a speaker, the system:

- 📢 announces the time every hour or 30 minutes  
- 🌍 automatically speaks in the language set in Home Assistant  
- ⏰ works only within a configurable time range 
- 🔔 can play a custom sound (by default the 'announce' (chime) sound) before the announcement
- 🔕 can disable voice announcement (chime only)
- 🏰 can play the Westminster melody at 12 o'clock  

The result is an elegant and discreet effect, ideal for home or office.

## ✨ Main features

### 🕑 Automatic time announcement
- every hour (xx:00)
- every half hour (xx:30)

### 🌐 Automatic multilingual support
- Italian 🇮🇹
- English 🇬🇧
- French 🇫🇷
- German 🇩🇪 (with correct handling of “halb”)
- Spanish 🇪🇸

automatic fallback to Italian

### ⏱️ Configurable time range
- e.g. only from 8:00 to 22:00

### 🔔 Optional chime
- 🔕 short silent announcement before TTS
- 🎵 custom sounds. If a path is defined, local sound

### 🧪 Test function
- to immediately test the announcement

### 🎯 Behavior
- Preset: "church-bell": default sound
- Preset: "simple-bell": bell chosen from library
- Preset: "custom" + empty path: Alexa 'announce' sound
- Preset: "custom" + valid path: plays a selected file
- Preset: "tower-clock": Westminster melody at 12 o'clock
- Use Chime: OFF: no sound, TTS only (time announcement)

## ⚙️ How it works

The heart of the system is the class:

class DigitalPendulum

which:
- registers to an internal timer (every 1 minute)
- checks:
  - whether the integration is enabled
  - whether the time is within the allowed range
  - whether the minute is 00 or 30
- builds the spoken text based on the language
- sends the announcement to the configured Alexa device

## 🗣️ Language handling

The language is automatically detected from:

self.hass.config.language

Announcement examples:

| Language | Time | Announcement |
|------|------|--------|
| 🇮🇹 IT | 10:30 | Ore 10 e trenta |
| 🇬🇧 EN | 14:00 | It's 14 o'clock |
| 🇫🇷 FR | 9:30 | Il est 9 heures trente |
| 🇩🇪 DE | 16:30 | Es ist halb 17 |
| 🇪🇸 ES | 11:00 | Son las 11 |

## 🔔 Chime (initial bell)

If the use_chime option is enabled:
- an empty announce is sent
- the system waits 1.3 seconds
- the TTS with the time starts  

This creates an effect similar to a real pendulum 🎶.

## 🧩 Configuration options

| Option | Description |
|------|------------|
| player | Target Alexa device |
| start_hour | Start time |
| end_hour | End time |
| enabled | Enable/disable the pendulum |
| tower-clock | Enable/disable 12 o'clock melody |
| use_chime | Enable/disable the chime |

Default values:

- ⏰ start_hour → DEFAULT_START_HOUR  
- ⏰ end_hour → DEFAULT_END_HOUR  
- 🔔 use_chime → DEFAULT_USE_CHIME  
- ✅ enabled → DEFAULT_ENABLED  

## 🧪 Immediate test

A manual test method is available:

async_test_announcement()

Which:
- reads the current time
- generates a full sentence (e.g. “It's 15:42”)
- immediately plays it on the Alexa device  

Useful to verify: language, volume, chime, correct TTS operation
